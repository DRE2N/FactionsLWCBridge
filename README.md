FactionsLWCBridge is an addon for [FactionsOne](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/factionsone.9249/) and [LWC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lwc.2150/) / [EntityLWC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lwc-unofficial-entity-locking.2162/). It allows faction leaders to remove and / or bypass all protections in their territory.

This plugin is for FactionsOne only. It will not work with different versions of Factions. Further features like auto deprotection on unclaim are not the purpose of this plugin; they *will not* get added.
